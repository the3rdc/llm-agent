I can't say enough good things about @FauxCo! From the quality of the materials to the fair labor practices, this brand truly walks the walk when it comes to sustainability.
I was really excited to try out @FauxCo's sustainable clothing, but I was disappointed by the quality of the fabric. It didn't feel durable at all.
I wish @FauxCo would expand their size range. As someone who doesn't fit into their current offerings, I feel excluded from their sustainable mission.
Just got my first order from FauxCo and I am in love! The quality is amazing and the fact that it's eco-friendly just makes me feel even better about my purchase.
I love that @FauxCo is transparent about their supply chain and manufacturing process. It's so important to know where our clothes come from.
Just discovered @FauxCo and I am blown away by their beautiful designs and commitment to sustainability. I can't wait to shop more from this amazing brand!
Can't stop raving about @FauxCo's commitment to sustainability. It's refreshing to see a fashion brand that cares about the environment.
Obsessed with my new FauxCo dress! Not only is it super stylish, but I know I'm supporting a company that's doing good for the planet.
Not impressed with the fit of the dress I ordered from @FauxCo. The measurements were off and it was too tight in some places, too loose in others.
I never thought I could be a sustainable fashionista, but @FauxCo has shown me that it's possible! Their clothes are chic, eco-friendly, and ethical.
Disappointed in the customer service at @FauxCo. My order was delayed and it took forever to get a response from their team.
Just received my order from @FauxCo and the quality is not what I expected. Definitely not worth the high price tag.
I appreciate @FauxCo's sustainable mission, but the prices are just too high for me to justify.
I was excited to try @FauxCo's clothes, but the fit was all wrong. Not sure if I'll be shopping with them again.
Thank you, @FauxCo, for creating beautiful clothes that I can feel good about wearing! I love knowing that I'm making a positive impact with my fashion choices.
